Re-prompt the user to fill out the issue template with additional questions based on their answer (bug or enhancement).\\n3.

This might help you identify the root cause of the issue.\\n4. **Check for conflicts with other plugins or loaders**: As you mentioned, you're using Apollo-Upload-Client and GraphQL-JS, which might be causing issues. Try disabling these plugins or loaders temporarily to see if it resolves the problem.\\n5. **Use a more detailed error message**: Instead of relying on the default error message, try enabling more verbose logging in your `webpack.config.js` file by setting `stats: 'verbose'`.\\n6. **Inspect the source maps**: Since the error seems related to source maps, inspect the generated source map files to see if there are any issues with them.\\n7. **Test on a local environment with similar settings**: Try replicating the GCP cloudbuild environment locally by using a Docker image or a similar setup. This might help you isolate the issue.\\n\\nBy following these hints, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of this issue.\\n\\n**Classification:** Bug report        1\n",

       "       '**Blog: How is the Autocomplete feature implemented in real life?**\\n\\nHave you ever wondered how some search engines or commercial portals can match the entered letters to whatever words you\\'re trying to type almost instinctively? Are they simply attempting to match the entered letters in a database, or are they using some \"intelligence\" to find what you\\'re looking for?\\n\\nAs it turns out, this feature, known as Autocomplete, can be implemented via standard data structures. One of the most naive methods is linear search and binary search, but these methods become inefficient when dealing with typo-tolerance.\\n\\nOther efficient data structures include TRIE (Trie) and Ternary Search Tree, but the real winner here is Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees). These trees can optimize your Autocomplete feature up to 40 times faster. But how do they manage to do so?\\n\\n**The Power of BK-Trees**\\n\\nBK-Trees rest on the concept of Levenshtein distance, which measures the minimum number of operations needed to translate one string into another. This makes it efficient for nearest neighbor search with a logarithmic time complexity and also boosts performance for fuzzy search.\\n\\n**Understanding TRIE**\\n\\nTRIE stands for \"Trie\" (a prefix tree). It\\'s a data structure that allows you to store a collection of strings in a way that enables fast searching, insertion, and deletion. A TRIE is essentially a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has multiple children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node with the same prefix, and another pointing to the next node with the same suffix.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Ternary Search Tree**\\n\\nA Ternary Search Tree (TST) is similar to a TRIE but has three children per node instead of one. This allows for faster searching and insertion operations.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has three children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees)**\\n\\nA BK-Tree is a more advanced data structure that\\'s specifically designed for nearest neighbor search. It uses the Levenshtein distance to measure the similarity between strings.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node in the tree represents a string.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and traverse down the tree until you reach the node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n* The Levenshtein distance is used to measure the similarity between strings. This allows for efficient nearest neighbor search.\\n\\n**Implementation**\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you could implement Autocomplete using BK-Trees in Python:\\n```python\\nimport math\\n\\nclass BKTree:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.root = Node(None)\\n\\n    class Node:\\n        def __init__(self, word):\\n            self.word = word\\n            self.children = []\\n            self.distance = 0\\n\\n        def add_child(self, child):\\n            self.children.append(child)\\n            self.distance += 1\\n\\n    def insert(self, word):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in word:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                new_node = BKTree.Node(word)\\n                node.add_child(new_node)\\n                node = new_node\\n\\n    def search(self, prefix):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in prefix:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                return None\\n        return node.word\\n\\n# Example usage\\ntree = BKTree()\\nwords = [\"hello\", \"hell\", \"world\"]\\nfor word in words:\\n    tree.insert(word)\\n\\nprint(tree.search(\"hel\"))  # Output: hello\\n```\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nAutocomplete is a powerful feature that can be implemented using various data structures, including TRIE, Ternary Search Tree, and Burkhard Keller Trees. BK-Trees are particularly efficient for nearest neighbor search and fuzzy search.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we explored the basics of Autocomplete and how it can be implemented using standard data structures. We also examined the advantages and disadvantages of each method and provided examples of how they can be used in practice.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re building a search engine or a commercial portal, understanding Autocomplete is crucial for providing an excellent user experience. By implementing Autocomplete correctly, you can help users find what they\\'re looking for quickly and efficiently.\\n\\n**Metadata**\\n\\n* Category: Not a bug report\\n* Title: How is the Autocomplete feature implemented in real life?\\n* Description: This blog post explores the implementation of Autocomplete using various data structures.\\n* Tags: autocomplete, TRIE, Ternary Search Tree, Burkhard Keller Trees, nearest neighbor search, fuzzy search',\n",

Try disabling these plugins or loaders temporarily to see if it resolves the problem.\\n5. **Use a more detailed error message**: Instead of relying on the default error message, try enabling more verbose logging in your `webpack.config.js` file by setting `stats: 'verbose'`.\\n6. **Inspect the source maps**: Since the error seems related to source maps, inspect the generated source map files to see if there are any issues with them.\\n7. **Test on a local environment with similar settings**: Try replicating the GCP cloudbuild environment locally by using a Docker image or a similar setup. This might help you isolate the issue.\\n\\nBy following these hints, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of this issue.\\n\\n**Classification:** Bug report\",\n",

       "       '**Blog: How is the Autocomplete feature implemented in real life?**\\n\\nHave you ever wondered how some search engines or commercial portals can match the entered letters to whatever words you\\'re trying to type almost instinctively? Are they simply attempting to match the entered letters in a database, or are they using some \"intelligence\" to find what you\\'re looking for?\\n\\nAs it turns out, this feature, known as Autocomplete, can be implemented via standard data structures. One of the most naive methods is linear search and binary search, but these methods become inefficient when dealing with typo-tolerance.\\n\\nOther efficient data structures include TRIE (Trie) and Ternary Search Tree, but the real winner here is Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees). These trees can optimize your Autocomplete feature up to 40 times faster. But how do they manage to do so?\\n\\n**The Power of BK-Trees**\\n\\nBK-Trees rest on the concept of Levenshtein distance, which measures the minimum number of operations needed to translate one string into another. This makes it efficient for nearest neighbor search with a logarithmic time complexity and also boosts performance for fuzzy search.\\n\\n**Understanding TRIE**\\n\\nTRIE stands for \"Trie\" (a prefix tree). It\\'s a data structure that allows you to store a collection of strings in a way that enables fast searching, insertion, and deletion. A TRIE is essentially a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has multiple children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node with the same prefix, and another pointing to the next node with the same suffix.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Ternary Search Tree**\\n\\nA Ternary Search Tree (TST) is similar to a TRIE but has three children per node instead of one. This allows for faster searching and insertion operations.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has three children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees)**\\n\\nA BK-Tree is a more advanced data structure that\\'s specifically designed for nearest neighbor search. It uses the Levenshtein distance to measure the similarity between strings.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node in the tree represents a string.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and traverse down the tree until you reach the node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n* The Levenshtein distance is used to measure the similarity between strings. This allows for efficient nearest neighbor search.\\n\\n**Implementation**\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you could implement Autocomplete using BK-Trees in Python:\\n```python\\nimport math\\n\\nclass BKTree:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.root = Node(None)\\n\\n    class Node:\\n        def __init__(self, word):\\n            self.word = word\\n            self.children = []\\n            self.distance = 0\\n\\n        def add_child(self, child):\\n            self.children.append(child)\\n            self.distance += 1\\n\\n    def insert(self, word):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in word:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                new_node = BKTree.Node(word)\\n                node.add_child(new_node)\\n                node = new_node\\n\\n    def search(self, prefix):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in prefix:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                return None\\n        return node.word\\n\\n# Example usage\\ntree = BKTree()\\nwords = [\"hello\", \"hell\", \"world\"]\\nfor word in words:\\n    tree.insert(word)\\n\\nprint(tree.search(\"hel\"))  # Output: hello\\n```\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nAutocomplete is a powerful feature that can be implemented using various data structures, including TRIE, Ternary Search Tree, and Burkhard Keller Trees.

       "'**Blog: How is the Autocomplete feature implemented in real life?**\\n\\nHave you ever wondered how some search engines or commercial portals can match the entered letters to whatever words you\\'re trying to type almost instinctively? Are they simply attempting to match the entered letters in a database, or are they using some \"intelligence\" to find what you\\'re looking for?\\n\\nAs it turns out, this feature, known as Autocomplete, can be implemented via standard data structures. One of the most naive methods is linear search and binary search, but these methods become inefficient when dealing with typo-tolerance.\\n\\nOther efficient data structures include TRIE (Trie) and Ternary Search Tree, but the real winner here is Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees). These trees can optimize your Autocomplete feature up to 40 times faster. But how do they manage to do so?\\n\\n**The Power of BK-Trees**\\n\\nBK-Trees rest on the concept of Levenshtein distance, which measures the minimum number of operations needed to translate one string into another. This makes it efficient for nearest neighbor search with a logarithmic time complexity and also boosts performance for fuzzy search.\\n\\n**Understanding TRIE**\\n\\nTRIE stands for \"Trie\" (a prefix tree). It\\'s a data structure that allows you to store a collection of strings in a way that enables fast searching, insertion, and deletion. A TRIE is essentially a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has multiple children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node with the same prefix, and another pointing to the next node with the same suffix.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Ternary Search Tree**\\n\\nA Ternary Search Tree (TST) is similar to a TRIE but has three children per node instead of one. This allows for faster searching and insertion operations.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has three children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees)**\\n\\nA BK-Tree is a more advanced data structure that\\'s specifically designed for nearest neighbor search. It uses the Levenshtein distance to measure the similarity between strings.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node in the tree represents a string.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and traverse down the tree until you reach the node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n* The Levenshtein distance is used to measure the similarity between strings. This allows for efficient nearest neighbor search.\\n\\n**Implementation**\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you could implement Autocomplete using BK-Trees in Python:\\n```python\\nimport math\\n\\nclass BKTree:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.root = Node(None)\\n\\n    class Node:\\n        def __init__(self, word):\\n            self.word = word\\n            self.children = []\\n            self.distance = 0\\n\\n        def add_child(self, child):\\n            self.children.append(child)\\n            self.distance += 1\\n\\n    def insert(self, word):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in word:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                new_node = BKTree.Node(word)\\n                node.add_child(new_node)\\n                node = new_node\\n\\n    def search(self, prefix):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in prefix:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                return None\\n        return node.word\\n\\n# Example usage\\ntree = BKTree()\\nwords = [\"hello\", \"hell\", \"world\"]\\nfor word in words:\\n    tree.insert(word)\\n\\nprint(tree.search(\"hel\"))  # Output: hello\\n```\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nAutocomplete is a powerful feature that can be implemented using various data structures, including TRIE, Ternary Search Tree, and Burkhard Keller Trees. BK-Trees are particularly efficient for nearest neighbor search and fuzzy search.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we explored the basics of Autocomplete and how it can be implemented using standard data structures. We also examined the advantages and disadvantages of each method and provided examples of how they can be used in practice.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re building a search engine or a commercial portal, understanding Autocomplete is crucial for providing an excellent user experience. By implementing Autocomplete correctly, you can help users find what they\\'re looking for quickly and efficiently.\\n\\n**Metadata**\\n\\n* Category: Not a bug report\\n* Title: How is the Autocomplete feature implemented in real life?\\n* Description: This blog post explores the implementation of Autocomplete using various data structures.\\n* Tags: autocomplete, TRIE, Ternary Search Tree, Burkhard Keller Trees, nearest neighbor search, fuzzy search'"

    "                         '**Blog: How is the Autocomplete feature implemented in real life?**\\n\\nHave you ever wondered how some search engines or commercial portals can match the entered letters to whatever words you\\'re trying to type almost instinctively? Are they simply attempting to match the entered letters in a database, or are they using some \"intelligence\" to find what you\\'re looking for?\\n\\nAs it turns out, this feature, known as Autocomplete, can be implemented via standard data structures. One of the most naive methods is linear search and binary search, but these methods become inefficient when dealing with typo-tolerance.\\n\\nOther efficient data structures include TRIE (Trie) and Ternary Search Tree, but the real winner here is Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees). These trees can optimize your Autocomplete feature up to 40 times faster. But how do they manage to do so?\\n\\n**The Power of BK-Trees**\\n\\nBK-Trees rest on the concept of Levenshtein distance, which measures the minimum number of operations needed to translate one string into another. This makes it efficient for nearest neighbor search with a logarithmic time complexity and also boosts performance for fuzzy search.\\n\\n**Understanding TRIE**\\n\\nTRIE stands for \"Trie\" (a prefix tree). It\\'s a data structure that allows you to store a collection of strings in a way that enables fast searching, insertion, and deletion. A TRIE is essentially a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has multiple children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* Each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node with the same prefix, and another pointing to the next node with the same suffix.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Ternary Search Tree**\\n\\nA Ternary Search Tree (TST) is similar to a TRIE but has three children per node instead of one. This allows for faster searching and insertion operations.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node has three children, representing the possible characters that can come after the current character.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and follow the child nodes until you reach the leaf node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n\\n**Burkhard Keller Trees (BK-Trees)**\\n\\nA BK-Tree is a more advanced data structure that\\'s specifically designed for nearest neighbor search. It uses the Levenshtein distance to measure the similarity between strings.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works:\\n\\n* Each node in the tree represents a string.\\n* The root node represents the empty string.\\n* When searching for a word, you start at the root node and traverse down the tree until you reach the node that corresponds to the desired word.\\n* The Levenshtein distance is used to measure the similarity between strings. This allows for efficient nearest neighbor search.\\n\\n**Implementation**\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you could implement Autocomplete using BK-Trees in Python:\\n```python\\nimport math\\n\\nclass BKTree:\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        self.root = Node(None)\\n\\n    class Node:\\n        def __init__(self, word):\\n            self.word = word\\n            self.children = []\\n            self.distance = 0\\n\\n        def add_child(self, child):\\n            self.children.append(child)\\n            self.distance += 1\\n\\n    def insert(self, word):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in word:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                new_node = BKTree.Node(word)\\n                node.add_child(new_node)\\n                node = new_node\\n\\n    def search(self, prefix):\\n        node = self.root\\n        for char in prefix:\\n            found = False\\n            for child in node.children:\\n                if child.word.startswith(char):\\n                    node = child\\n                    found = True\\n                    break\\n            if not found:\\n                return None\\n        return node.word\\n\\n# Example usage\\ntree = BKTree()\\nwords = [\"hello\", \"hell\", \"world\"]\\nfor word in words:\\n    tree.insert(word)\\n\\nprint(tree.search(\"hel\"))  # Output: hello\\n```\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nAutocomplete is a powerful feature that can be implemented using various data structures, including TRIE, Ternary Search Tree, and Burkhard Keller Trees. BK-Trees are particularly efficient for nearest neighbor search and fuzzy search.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we explored the basics of Autocomplete and how it can be implemented using standard data structures. We also examined the advantages and disadvantages of each method and provided examples of how they can be used in practice.\\n\\nWhether you\\'re building a search engine or a commercial portal, understanding Autocomplete is crucial for providing an excellent user experience. By implementing Autocomplete correctly, you can help users find what they\\'re looking for quickly and efficiently.\\n\\n**Metadata**\\n\\n* Category: Not a bug report\\n* Title: How is the Autocomplete feature implemented in real life?\\n* Description: This blog post explores the implementation of Autocomplete using various data structures.\\n* Tags: autocomplete, TRIE, Ternary Search Tree, Burkhard Keller Trees, nearest neighbor search, fuzzy search',\n",
