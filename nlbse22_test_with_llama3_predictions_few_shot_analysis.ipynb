This behavior seems unnecessary and may be considered a bug or a feature that should be configurable.\\n\\nThe description of the issue includes several updates with various sources and discussions related to the topic, including Firefox's handling of favicons, browser differences, and potential workarounds.

You can ensure this by searching the issue list for this repository. If there is a duplicate, please close your issue and add a comment to the existing issue instead.\\r\\n--&gt;\\r\\nAs secureCodeBox operations user i would like to integrate and configure custom S3 based persistence services instead of public available services like AWS Buckets, GCP Storage or DO. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\\r\\n&lt;!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] --&gt;\\r\\nBy now it is already possible to configure a custom S3 Backend as documented here: \\r\\n- https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation#using-a-hosted-s3-buckets-as-storage-backend\\r\\n- https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/operator#chart-configuration\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one feature is missing in the case of custom/internal S3 Services. It must be possible to add and configure custom root CA's for all secureCodeBox Components (Operator, Scanner, Hooks,...) to ensure a valid TLS based connection, if the custom S3 Service uses non public avaliable certificates.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\n&lt;!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. --&gt;\\r\\nImplement a configuration Option for all HelmCharts to add a custom Root CA based on a given configMap containing the CA Certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSCB Components involved here:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] SCB Operator: https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/operator\\r\\n- [x] SCB Lurcher: https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/lurcher\\r\\n- [x] All Scanner Parser ([parseDefinition](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/parse-definition)):  https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/scanners ...\\r\\n- [x] All Hooks ([ScanCompletionHook](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/scan-completion-hook)): https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/hooks ...\\r\\n\\r\\n## Implementation Hints:\\r\\nRegarding the parseDefinition and ScanCompletionHook CRDs we have already implemented the possibility for _ENV_, _Mount_ and _FileMount_ configurations in the corresponding SCB CRD and controller.

You can ensure this by searching the issue list for this repository. If there is a duplicate, please close your issue and add a comment to the existing issue instead.\\r\\n-->\\r\\nAs secureCodeBox operations user i would like to integrate and configure custom S3 based persistence services instead of public available services like AWS Buckets, GCP Storage or DO. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\\r\\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\\r\\nBy now it is already possible to configure a custom S3 Backend as documented here: \\r\\n- https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation#using-a-hosted-s3-buckets-as-storage-backend\\r\\n- https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/operator#chart-configuration\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one feature is missing in the case of custom/internal S3 Services. It must be possible to add and configure custom root CA's for all secureCodeBox Components (Operator, Scanner, Hooks,...) to ensure a valid TLS based connection, if the custom S3 Service uses non public avaliable certificates.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\\r\\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\\r\\nImplement a configuration Option for all HelmCharts to add a custom Root CA based on a given configMap containing the CA Certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSCB Components involved here:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] SCB Operator: https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/operator\\r\\n- [x] SCB Lurcher: https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/lurcher\\r\\n- [x] All Scanner Parser ([parseDefinition](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/parse-definition)):  https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/scanners ...\\r\\n- [x] All Hooks ([ScanCompletionHook](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/scan-completion-hook)): https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/hooks ...\\r\\n\\r\\n## Implementation Hints:\\r\\nRegarding the parseDefinition and ScanCompletionHook CRDs we have already implemented the possibility for _ENV_, _Mount_ and _FileMount_ configurations in the corresponding SCB CRD and controller. Additional informations are documented in issue #212.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is missing here is to add this configuration option to all Scanner and Hooks HelmChart by default.
