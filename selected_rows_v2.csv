8,enhancement,Feature Request: Add a way to go back to previous Meme,"## Feature:
Sometimes people would like to revisit an old meme that they flew by in a hurry. To avoid this, we can add a temporary storage which will allow us to revisit the old memes as well as go ahead.

This can be easily achieved with help of caching or using any kind of dynamic data structure to hold onto some amount of previous memes you can come across.  "

10,bug,download.topo() failing on NOAA server,"`download.topo()` is failing today, as pointed out in https://github.com/ArgoCanada/argoFloats/issues/368, but the issue is not with `argoFloats`, I think, but rather with `oce::download.topo()` or, shall I say, with the NOAA server.  This has been failing for a couple of hours now.  If it is still failing tomorrow, I'll try looking on the NOAA site to see if they have changed the API, which they seem to do, every few months :-)"

**Actual behavior:**
Reading through the lib2020.intl.d.ts I noticed a couple of issues in the declarations:
1. Locale should not be `BCP47LanguageTag`, it should be `UnicodeBCP47LocaleIdentifier`.
2. RelativeTimeFormat interface and const declaration should be combined into a single `class`.
